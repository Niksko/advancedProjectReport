    Evolutionary dynamics is the branch of biology concerned with studying how populations of invidivuals with inherited traits change over time.
    Performing simulations and calculations related to game theoretic views of evolutionary dynamics can be computationally intensive.
    In this project we have developed a library for performing common computational evolutionary dynamics calculations in the high performance scientific computing language Julia.
