\section{Introduction}

Computational evolutionary dynamics studies the way that populations involve when subject to inheritance of traits and mutation.
The theoretical aspects of computational evolutionary dynamics are rooted in the mathematical discipline of game theory, however it is often useful to verify results with simulations.
As the computations involved are generally repetitive and similar across various scenarios, it becomes useful to create packages of commonly used functions.

Packages for performing evolutionary dynamics calculations exist for languages such as Python \cite{pyevodyn} an Mathematica \cite{dynamo}. however these languages are notorious for being orders of magnitude slower than C or FORTRAN.
However high performance languages like C or FORTRAN are low level languages and as such are more difficult to read and to program in.
