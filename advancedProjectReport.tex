\title{JEDy: A Julia package for Evolutionary Dynamics}

\section*{Objectives}

The objectives of this advanced project are to:

\begin{itemize}
        
    \item Become familiar with standard methods for studying evolutionary dynamics computationally and analytically
    \item Become familiar with the Julia \cite{julia} language and its use in scientific computing
    \item Replicate the results of some seminal papers in the field of evolutionary dynamics using Julia
    \item Kickstart the development of an open-source package for studying evolutionary dynamics using Julia

\end{itemize}

\section*{Progress}

So far I have been familiarising myself with the Julia language by attempting to replicate part of the results of a paper \cite{imhofetal} which studies the iterated prisoners dilemma.
In the paper, the authors use both a deterministic model of evolutionary dynamics (the replicatior-mutator equation) and a stochastic model (the Moran process) to determine the dynamics of the system.
I have been focussing on the stochastic model.

I have succeeded in reproducing the behavior that is shown in the aforementioned paper for identical values of the parameters.
The code that I have developed should be able to handle matrix games of arbitrary rank (ie. not just the Prisoner's Dilemma), however I have as yet been unable to test this functionality.
In addition to simulating the Moran process, I have also written code to determine the transition matrix of the game between various states, and as such I am able to calculate fixation probabilites and stationary distributions for arbitrary simple matrix games.
